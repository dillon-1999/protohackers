# Protohackers Challenges

A collection of my implementations for the Protohackers network programming problems.  
Each problem is written with an emphasis on clear protocol handling, correctness, and predictable behavior under load.

## Goals

- Strengthen low-level network programming skills  
- Work through bare‐bones TCP servers without relying on HTTP frameworks  
- Practice handling malformed input, partial reads, backpressure, and long-lived connections  
- Explore performance characteristics in Go (buffering, allocation, concurrency patterns)
